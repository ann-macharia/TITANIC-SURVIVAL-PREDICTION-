# TITANIC-SURVIVAL-PREDICTION-
The titanic was one of the major developments in the transport industry. It was a big ship that was built in the early 90's for passenger and cargo transportation.

The maiden voyage for the titanic was on April 10th, 1912 where it set out from a Southampton port. It headed to france to pick more passengers and cargo a ports Quuenbourg and Cherbourgh.

Sadly, On April 15th, 1917, the titanic was not able to reach its destination Newyork as it hit an iceberg. The collision caused water to start leaking and the ship started sinking. There were efforts to try and save the passengers, but unfortunately not all passengers survived.

A predictive model will be created to determine whether a passenger survived or not given features of the passengers. These features include: Gender, Class etc.
